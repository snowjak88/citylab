Tiles are aligned on a dimetric grid.
Camera from 60 degrees x 45 degrees

A single grid-tile may be modeled by a rectilinear solid with vertices at extremes:

x, y, z
-2.82842712, 0, -2.82842712
+2.82842712, 1.1547005, +2.82842712

Each unit altitude-change is Y = 1.1547005
The "sub-surface" is assumed to be 1 unit altitude-change
